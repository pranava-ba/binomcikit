---ies of independent trials. This problem arises in fields such as clinical trials, quality control, social science research, financial risk assessment, and ecological studies, where quantifying binary outcomes (success/failure) is essential. The sample proportion $\hat{p}$ serves as the primary point estimate for the true proportion $p$, while confidence intervals or Bayesian methods are employed to express uncertainty.

Challenges include addressing boundary conditions (proportions near 0 or 1), managing small sample sizes, and selecting appropriate methods to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. Despite its ubiquity, specialized computational tools for binomial proportion estimation remain underdeveloped in Python. While existing statistical packages (e.g., SciPy, statsmodels) offer generalized solutions, they lack tailored implementations for nuanced scenarios such as Bayesian inference with weakly informative priors, exact confidence interval methods for small samples, or coverage probability optimization.

## Statement of need
Estimating binomial proportions is a fundamental statistical problem with applications across various fields, including healthcare, business, manufacturing, and finance. Despite its importance, Python lacks a dedicated package specifically designed for binomial proportion estimation, requiring users to rely on general statistical tools that do not always address specific challenges like boundary issues or advanced inference methods. Developing a specialized Python package for binomial proportion estimation would fill this gap, providing users with tailored functions for more accurate and accessible analysis.
## Estimation Methods for Binomial Proportions

### 1. Wald Interval

* Formula:

  $$\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$$

* Key Considerations:
  * Prone to boundary violations (0 or 1)
  * Use continuity correction $(\hat{p} \pm 0.5/n)$ for small $n$

### 2. Wald-T Interval

* Formula:

  $$\hat{p} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$$

* Key Considerations:
  * Uses $t$-distribution (uncommon for proportions)
  * Similar boundary issues as Wald; continuity correction applicable

### 3. Likelihood Interval (Exact/Clopper-Pearson)

* Method: Inverts binomial test for exact coverage
* Formula: Solve for $p$ in:

  $$\sum_{k=x}^n \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = \alpha/2 \quad \text{(upper/lower bounds)}$$

* Key Considerations:
  * Conservative (guarantees $\geq 95\%$ coverage)
  * No boundary issues; no correction needed

### 4. Score Interval (Wilson Interval)

* Formula:

  $$\frac{\hat{p} + \frac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{2n} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n} + \frac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{4n^2}}}{1 + \frac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{n}}$$

* Key Considerations:
  * Robust for small $n$ and extreme $\hat{p}$
  * No continuity correction needed

### 5. Logit-Wald Interval

* Method: Applies logit transformation:

  $$\text{logit}(\hat{p}) = \ln\left(\frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}}\right) \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{1}{n\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}}$$

  Back-transform using logistic function.

* Key Considerations:
  * Handles extreme $\hat{p}$ better; unstable for $\hat{p}=0/1$

### 6. ArcSine Interval

* Method: Variance-stabilizing transformation:

  $$\sin^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\hat{p}}\right) \pm \frac{z_{\alpha/2}}{2\sqrt{n}}$$

  Back-transform with $\sin^2(\cdot)$

* Key Considerations:
  * Effective for extreme $\hat{p}$; no correction needed

### Best Practices

* Use Wilson or Likelihood for small $n$
* Prefer Logit-Wald or ArcSine for extreme $\hat{p}$
* Avoid Wald for $n < 30$ or $\hat{p}$ near 0/1

## Summary Table

| Method | Formula | Key Issues/Considerations |
|--------|---------|-------------------------|
| Wald Interval | $\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$ | Boundary issues; continuity correction for small $n$ |
| Wald-T Interval | $\hat{p} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$ | Better for small $n$; similar boundary issues |
| Likelihood Interval | Based on likelihood ratio test | No boundary issues; exact method |
| Score Interval | Complex formula (see text) | Robust for small $n$ and extremes |
| Logit-Wald | Logit transform + Wald | Handles extremes; unstable at 0/1 |
| ArcSine | $\sin^{-1}(\sqrt{\hat{p}})$ transform | Stabilizes variance at extremes |
